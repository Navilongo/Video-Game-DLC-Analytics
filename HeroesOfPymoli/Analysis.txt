Analysis of Heroes of Pymoli

Reviewing the information gathered from the data visualization, we can still see three important
points that were mined from the data, who are the top spenders, their ages and what is the top item purchased. 
By gathering all the information we can see that Males between 15-29
are the most active consumers of downloadable content within video games. Just in this range we can see that 77% 
of the total purchases happened in this range, the 20-24 year olds being the largest consumers at 365 purchases 
likely because of their amount of free time and disposable income. Among the purchases, among the top 5, we can
see weapons as being the most purchased led by blades, greatswords, a razor of black magic and a crying steel sickle. 
If we wanted to create more items for Heroes of Pymoli, I would recommend more weapons geared toward post-adolescent
males, as these would be higher likely to sell.
